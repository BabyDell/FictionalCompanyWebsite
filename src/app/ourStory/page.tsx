            From Passion to Pizza Perfection
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Inferno Blaze Pizza was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to
            create the perfect pizza experience. Our journey began in 2010 when
            two pizza-loving friends, Maria and John, decided to turn their
            passion into a business.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            What started as a small operation in a tiny kitchen has now grown
            into a beloved local chain, serving thousands of happy customers
            every day. Our commitment to quality ingredients, innovative
            recipes, and exceptional customer service has remained unchanged
            since day one.
